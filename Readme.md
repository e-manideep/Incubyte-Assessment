**String Calculator**
**Overview:**
This project implements a simple String calculator with the ability to add numbers provided as strings. The Add method takes a string input and returns the sum of the numbers contained within the string.

We start by handling the easiest case: when the input is empty. Then, we deal with cases involving one or two numbers. After that, the method can handle single numbers and multiple numbers in the input. It can also manage new lines between numbers, not just commas.

The calculator lets users choose their own delimiter for numbers. If there's a negative number, the calculator throws an error because it doesn't accept negatives. Lastly, it ignores numbers larger than 1000.

This approach ensures the calculator works smoothly while keeping things simple and easy to understand.
